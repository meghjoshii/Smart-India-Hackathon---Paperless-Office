Paperless-OfficePaperless Office, a paperless way to manage workflows and files.

Workflow Management Tool for predefined processes that can be broken up into Stories and Tasks. This is not a solution for development (Clubhouse, Jira, etc) but rather for banks, law firms, etc that have repeating processes and personel involed.
File Storage Solution similar to google drive. Files can be approved and even contain digital signatutes.
Configurable in the way that access roles can be defined by the organization and is not a constant set. Email can be integrated as well to communicate in organization defined workflows.
